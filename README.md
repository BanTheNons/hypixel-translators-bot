# Contributing
As this is a custom-made bot, it has a lot of features that depend on our server and may be hard to test on a bot of your own. If you'd like to contribute by adding a command/feature or fixing a bug, we recommend copying/creating the file to your bot and doing your tests and, once you're sure all bugs are fixed, feel free to make the pull request. We will test every pull request before it's merged and we can work together to fix any potential bugs if something goes wrong. If you have any questions about this process, please DM Rodry#4020 on Discord.

# Translation [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/hypixel-translators-bot/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/hypixel-translators-bot)
The bot has a `+language` command which allows you to change your language when using it. You can also help translate it to your language! We currently support all languages on the Hypixel project, plus some other ones requested by the community. If your language isn't supported yet, please let us know and we will work on implementing it.

## Want to help?
To join the translation project, please make a join request [here](https://crowdin.com/project/hypixel-translators-bot) and include your Discord tag (Stannya#0001 for example) or your Discord ID. If you don't include at least one of these, you will be denied even if we know who you are. This is so that we can give you access to the special category made for bot translators on the server.

## Just want to check it out?
In order to change your language, execute `+language <language>`. If you find any bugs, please let us know by adding an issue [here](https://github.com/Hypixel-Translators/hypixel-translators-bot/issues). Keep in mind you do not have to join the translation project in order to use the language, but it may not be fully translated.
